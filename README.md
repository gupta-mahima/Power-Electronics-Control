# Power-Electronics-Control

Plug & Play Power Electronics (P4) - Control is a platform compatible to operate a typical power electronic converter. This first version plugs-in an Arduino Due board for quick prototyping!

The Gerber files are available for download. The first prototype of P4-Control is in verification stage.
